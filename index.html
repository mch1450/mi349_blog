            <h2>Succulent Plant</h2>
            <p>By Megan Cheng | <time>October 10, 2022 8:24 PM</time></p>

            <p>This is a succulent I bought in the beginning of the semester. For some reason the leaves are dying already... 
                I don't know if it's because I'm overwatering or underwatering it but I don't think it's going to last until summer.</p>

            <h2>Mint Chocolate Chip</h2>
            <p>By Megan Cheng | <time>October 10, 2022 8:24 PM</time></p>

            <p><img src="mintic.jpg" alt="Mint Chocolate chip ice cream"></p>
            <p>I don't understand why so many people have a burning hatred for mint chocolate chip ice cream. 
                I think it tastes pretty good. It doesn't taste like toothpaste to me. 
                What brand of toothpaste do all these people use? </p>
